#### WordPress Changes & Details the Plugin Keeps a Log Of
As a comprehensive & complete WordPress activity log solution WP Security Audit Log does not just tell you that a post, a user profile, or an object was updated. It keeps a log of what was changed within the post, profile or object.

Below is a summary of the changes that the plugin can keep a record of:

* **Post, Page and Custom Post Type changes** such as status, [content changes](https://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/support-documentation/how-keep-record-of-content-changes/), title, URL, date and custom field changes

* **Tags and Categories changes** such as creating, modifying or deleting them, and adding or removing them from posts

* **Widgets and Menus changes** such as creating, modifying or deleting them

* **User changes** such as user created or registered, deleted or added to a site on multisite network

* **User profile changes** such as password, email, display name and role changes

* **User activity** such as login, logout, failed logins and terminating other sessions

* **WordPress core and settings changes** such as installed updates, permalinks, default role, URL and other site-wide changes

* **WordPress multisite network changes** such as adding, deleting or archiving sites, adding or removing users from sites etc ([activity logs for multisite networks](https://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/support-documentation/audit-trail-features-wordpress-multisite/)).

* **Plugins and Themes changes** such as installing, activating, deactivating, uninstalling and updating them

* **WordPress database changes** such as when a plugin adds or removes a table

* Changes on **WooCommerce Stores & Products**, **Yoast SEO**, **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**, **MainWP** and other popular WordPress plugins.

* **[WordPress site file changes](https://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/support-documentation/wordpress-files-changes-warning-activity-logs/)** such as new files are added, or existing ones are modified or deleted.

For every event that the plugin keeps a log of it also reports the:

* Date & time (and milliseconds) of when it happened,
