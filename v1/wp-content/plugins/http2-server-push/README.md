# HTTP/2 Server Push for WordPress

HTTP/2 is the newest version of the HTTP protocol that powers the Web. Based on the SPDY protocol from Google, it uses multiple binary *streams* to transmit more than one file over one connection at the same time. *Server Push* is how an HTTP/2 server starts sending additional files, such as JavaScript and CSS, to the browser before the browser realizes it needs them.

This plugin enables server push for local JavaScript and CSS resources enqueued in the page. Plugins & themes that
output tags directly in the page markup won't be affected.

Tested with [nghttpx](https://nghttp2.org/documentation/nghttpx-howto.html) and [h2o](https://h2o.examp1e.net). LiteSpeed and OpenLiteSpeed do not currently support server push, but this plugin is expected to work seamlessly once they support this feature.

## WordPress 4.6 and above
WordPress 4.6 introduced [native support for resource hints](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/06/resource-hints-in-4-6/).
By default, this plugin defers to WordPress 4.6 and theme/plugin developers to responsibly prefetch the right assets. Sites running
on older versions of WordPress will continue to get the previous behavior where all JavaScript and stylesheets had resource hints
printed for them.

I've added a filter To restore the old behavior (hint everything) on WordPress 4.6 and above. To use it, add this line to
your theme's functions.php file or a custom plugin:

`add_filter('http2_render_resource_hints', '__return_true');`
